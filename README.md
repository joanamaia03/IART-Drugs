# Instructions
## How to compile and run?
- Please open the drug_consumption.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook and run all the cells
  
## How to use the programm?
- You just need to run all the cells and wait for the results

## Drug Consumption

- Firstly we perform exploratory data analysis, not only studying the attributes of the dataset, but also sanitizing it and checking for flaws like missing or duplicated values.
- After that we apply a variety of supervised learning algorithms, such as a Decision Tree, a Random Forest algorithm, K-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), and Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- Once the algorithms finished, we evaluated the results of the performance for the implemented algorithms using key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1 score.
- With this data, we assess the models using both training and test datasets to ensure robustness and avoid overfitting.
